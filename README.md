## Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/adamjmurray/ableton-modulation-sequencer/archive/master.zip)
2. Unpack all files in the zip to a folder (be sure to keep all the files together, I haven't "frozen" the device)
3. Add the `MIDI Modulation Sequencer.amx` MIDI effect to your Live Set
4. Change some steps, setup MIDI modulation for modulation, aftertouch, and/or pitch bend on the instrument on the same track
5. Change some sequencer steps
6. Play (the device only outputs when the transport is running)

## Features
* Indepedent sequencers of up to 64 steps for mod wheel, aftertouch, and pitch bend
* 3 step patterns in each sequencer with independent loop points for easy polyrhythms and pseudo-random patterns
* Slew control to smooth the output
* Multiple output modes combine the 3 step patterns: add 3 (normalized add), add, min, max, random
* Randomization and auto-randomization
